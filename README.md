# Employee_RMS_Blockchain
This repository contains all the code to create blockchain-based employee record management system. 

## Smart Contract
1. First of all we need to create a smart contract using ChainIDE, available at https://chainide.com/. 
2. Once we have completed writing down our smart contract, we need to comiple it, and after successful compilation we can get an ABI code.
3. The third step is deployment of a smart contract on any blockchain. For this tutorial, we used Etherem Faucet network- Ropsten Test Network, before we can successfult deploy our smart contract on the blockchain, we need to install the metamask extension to our browser, and need to buy some faucet ethers to pay the gas fee for deploying the smart contract to the blockchain and make transactions to the deployed smart contract.
4. After successful deployement, it's time to interact with the deployed smart contract using a webpage, for that purpose, we need to import web3 library which is: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ethereum/web3.js/dist/web3.min.js, then we create a web structure using simple HTML tags, make a structure little good looking using CSS, and integerate the front-end with the deployed smart contract using javascript and web3 library. 

That's all, if you face any problem while implementing this simple tutorial, feel free to ask, and if you want to have discussion with the developers from academia and industry, you can join our telegram group: https://t.me/joinchat/Q48BNwB-f8RlZTJl.

Thanks for visiting this tutorial, we will try our best to present complex ideas in thier possible simplest form.
